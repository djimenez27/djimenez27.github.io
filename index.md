#### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because we had to create a number guessing game between two players. I’ve always been curious about how games are programmed so this was a brief introduction. I learned and practiced how to initialize variables, use input/output operations, and write if, else, and else if statements. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was my favorite lab because it taught me how to play and code a game of blackjack. Before this lab I didn’t know how to play Blackjack and now I am more familiar with it. During this lab, I learned how to write functions that calculated the value of a blackjack hand, that determined if the hand busted, and also how to calculate the value of a hand with multiple aces.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because we had to calculate the Olympics average of scores. I enjoy watching the Olympics when it occurs and did not know how judges kept it fair. I learned how to code functions that calculated the average mean of all elements of a vector excluding the minimum and maximum elements.
